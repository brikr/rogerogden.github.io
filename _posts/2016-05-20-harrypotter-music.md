I grew up infatuated with the Harry Potter series. I read every single book within a week of it coming out. I'd skip meals, and I'd stay up after my parents had thought they tucked me in for the night to read just _one_ more chapter.

When the movies came out, I was incredibly excited, and I'm happy that they're a rare occurrence, in that the book-to-film adapatation was incredibly well-done. Something I hadn't considered when I was younger, and something that I increasingly appreciate, is the music that accompanies the films.

I recently learned that the scores for both _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ and _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ were done by the infallible [John Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams). It just so happens that those two scores are perhaps my favorites of all the films. However, the other films' composers: Nicholas Hooper, Patrick Doyle, and Alexandre Desplat do a great job of capturing the mood of the films, particularly _Showdown_, which appears on the _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2_ score and documents the final battle between Voldemort and the Hogswarts crew.

I want more music like this. I want music that explores the dusty corners of an English wizards' [pub](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Leaky_Cauldron), the [Great Hall](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Hall) during the [Yule Ball](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Yule_Ball), and Ron and Harry's frantic journey to get to Hogwarts in Arthur's car, only to be greeted by the [Whomping Willow](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Whomping_Willow).

J.K. Rowling created a universe that I got to see come to life before my very eyes. With a [new movie](http://www.fantasticbeasts.com/) on the horizon, I can't wait to explore the landscape through the [score](http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/-fantastic-beasts-james-newton-howard-to-score-jk-/404263).
