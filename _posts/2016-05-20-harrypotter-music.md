<p>I grew up infatuated with the Harry Potter series. I read every single book within a week of it coming out. I&#8217;d skip meals, and I&#8217;d stay up after my parents had thought they tucked me in for the night to read just <em>one</em> more chapter.</p>

<p>When the movies came out, I was incredibly excited, and I&#8217;m happy that they&#8217;re a rare occurrence, in that the book-to-film adapatation was incredibly well-done. Something I hadn&#8217;t considered when I was younger, and something that I increasingly appreciate, is the music that accompanies the films. </p>

<p>I recently learned that the scores for both <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> and <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> were done by the infallible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams">John Williams</a>. It just so happens that those two scores are perhaps my favorites of all the films. However, the other films&#8217; composers: Nicholas Hooper, Patrick Doyle, and Alexandre Desplat do a great job of capturing the mood of the films, particularly <em>Showdown</em>, which appears on the <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2</em> score and documents the final battle between Voldemort and the Hogswarts crew.</p>

<p>I want more music like this. I want music that explores the dusty corners of an English wizards&#8217; <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Leaky_Cauldron">pub</a>, the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Hall">Great Hall</a> during the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Yule_Ball">Yule Ball</a>, and Ron and Harry&#8217;s frantic journey to get to Hogwarts in Arthur&#8217;s car, only to be greeted by the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Whomping_Willow">Whomping Willow</a>. J.K. Rowling created a universe that I got to see come to life before my very eyes. With a <a href="http://www.fantasticbeasts.com/">new movie</a> on the horizon, I can&#8217;t wait to explore the landscape through the <a href="http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/-fantastic-beasts-james-newton-howard-to-score-jk-/404263">score</a>. </p>
