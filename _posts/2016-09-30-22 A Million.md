On his third studio album, Bon Iver wonders if life has meaning. You can hear it in every song. 

> Oh, then how we gonna cry, cause it once might not mean something

> No, I don't know the path of what kind of pith I've amassed. Long lines of questions, lessons, lessons, lessons

I think I've finally figured out why Vernon sings in barely-held-together falsetto and broken lines. Everything about Bon Iver is devastating, heavy. It's all he can muster.
